            DBC is a three month intensive course on web development. The topics studied there included basic algorithms, jQuery, Ruby/Rails, Git, CSS, and HTML, with a focus on collaboration and tools/tech relevant to the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            While at DBC I collaborated with a group of developers to create Awesome Bus, a web app and travel tool that integrated with the San Francisco Muni and Google Maps APIs. Awesome Bus provided users with granular travel information, taking into account reported delays and travel from the user’s current location via walking or cycling to the public transit stop of choice.
